I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/) in the [Department of Philosophy](https://arts.ucalgary.ca/philosophy), and I am currently supervised by [Dr. C. Kenneth Waters](http://www.ckennethwaters.com/). My research analyzes the assumptions of data-intensive scientific practices. My dissertation looks at how interdisciplinary interactions between researchers influence data acquisition and processing techniques. I am also interested in the relations between uses of modern technologies and methods of data organization, as well as the collection and analysis of data within citizen science projects.

You may find more information about my teaching and research projects along with a full CV from the navigation links above.

Outside of academic walls, I enjoy pampering my cat, pursuing fiber arts, reading fiction, playing video games, and tinkering with technology.
